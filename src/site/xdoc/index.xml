<section name="Joda Time - I18N support">
<p>
<a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/">Joda-Time</a> provides a complete quality alternative
to the JDK date and time classes.
Many aspects of date and time require internationalized data.
This project provides access to additional I18N data not supplied as part of the
standard Joda-Time release.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Time zones by territory</li>
<li>First day of week by territory</li>
<li>Business week by territory</li>
<li>Weekend by territory</li>
</ul>
<p>
As a flavour of the functionality, here's how to find out what days are the weekend in Egypt:
<source>
  Territory t = Territory.forID("EG");
  int weekendStartDay = t.getWeekendStart();
  int weekendEndDay = t.getWeekendEnd();
</source>
